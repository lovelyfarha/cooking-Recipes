The app should have a modern and eye-catching design.\n\nFeatures for the First Version:\n\n-   **Browse Recipes:** A home screen displaying a curated list of recipes with appealing visuals.\n-   **Recipe Details:** A dedicated screen for each recipe, showcasing the ingredient list, cooking steps, and built-in timer functionality.\n-   **Save Recipes:** Implement a feature for users to save their favorite recipes for easy access.\n\nDesign Elements:\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Base color: Light gray or off-white for a clean background.\n    -   Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    -   Accent colors: Vibrant orange or yellow to highlight key elements like buttons and timers.\n    -   Highlight shades: Lighter shades of the accent color for interactive elements.\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for headings and body text to ensure readability and a contemporary feel.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Examine existing components:** Look at the existing components like `Button`, `IconSymbol`, `ListItem`, and `IconCircle` to see how they can be used or modified for the recipe app.\n2.  **Create Recipe Model:** Define a data structure (interface or type) for a recipe, including fields for name, image, ingredients, steps, and cooking time.\n3.  **Implement Browse Recipes Screen:** Create a new screen (e.g., `app/recipes.tsx`) to display a list of recipes. Use `FlatList` (already imported in `app/(index)/index.tsx`) to render the recipes. Each recipe item should display the recipe name and a thumbnail image.\n4.  **Implement Recipe Details Screen:** Create a new screen (e.g., `app/recipe/[id].tsx`) to display the details of a selected recipe. This screen should include the ingredient list, cooking steps, and a timer component.\n5.  **Implement Timer Component:** Create a reusable timer component (e.g., `components/Timer.tsx`) that allows users to set and start timers for specific cooking steps.\n6.  **Implement Save Recipe Functionality:** Add a \"Save\" button to the Recipe Details screen. When pressed, the recipe should be saved to a local storage (e.g., using `AsyncStorage` from `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`).\n7.  **Update Browse Recipes Screen:** Add a visual cue (e.g., a filled heart icon) to indicate which recipes have been saved by the user.\n8.  **Implement Saved Recipes Screen:** Create a new screen (e.g., `app/saved.tsx`) to display a list of saved recipes.\n9.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between the Browse Recipes screen, Recipe Details screen, and Saved Recipes screen using `expo-router`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-28T16:23:00.791627"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a modern and eye-catching recipe app!
